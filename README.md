# Filter

To create your own filter over an image using RGB values, you can manipulate the individual color channels of each pixel in the image. RGB stands for red, green, and blue, which are the primary colors used in digital images.

Here's a summary of how you can use RGB values to create a filter:

Load the image: Read the image data into your program or use an image processing library to access the pixel data.

Iterate over each pixel: Loop through each pixel in the image to access its RGB values.

Adjust RGB values: Modify the RGB values of each pixel based on the desired filter effect. For example, you can increase or decrease the intensity of a specific color channel to enhance or reduce that color in the image.

Apply the changes: Update the RGB values of each pixel with the modified values.

Display or save the modified image: Once you have applied the filter by manipulating the RGB values, you can display the filtered image or save it to a file.

By altering the RGB values, you can achieve various effects and filters. For example:

Grayscale filter: Set the red, green, and blue values of each pixel to the same average value, resulting in a black-and-white image.
Sepia filter: Adjust the RGB values to create a warm, vintage look.
Color inversion filter: Invert each RGB value by subtracting it from the maximum value (255), producing a negative image effect.
Color enhancement filter: Increase or decrease the intensity of specific color channels to make certain colors more vibrant or subdued.
Experimenting with different combinations and variations of RGB values allows you to create unique and customized filters to transform the appearance of an image according to your preferences or specific creative requirements.
